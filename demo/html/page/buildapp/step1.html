We will build a small interactive app that lets users click and select animals from a list and shows their pictures.

Every app must have a an `index` page that loads COML. This pages will use `script` tags to load COML and any other javascript libraries
the app uses.

Here is a very sample `index.html` page that loads just the libs needed by COML (`jquery`,`requirejs` and `coml.js`).
The code around line 20 loads COML and attaches it to the element identified by the id `lift-off`.

Note the second parameter in `coml.attachTo("lift-off", 'frame.html');`. This is the first COML page and will set up the user interface of the app.
