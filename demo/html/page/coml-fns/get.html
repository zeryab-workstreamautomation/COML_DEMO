## `get(selectorOrNode: Node | string,getfunc?:(component:CoElement)=>any): CoElement;` 

Return a Component if the component has currently been instantiated for this selector or node

if a getfunc is provided, this is called exactly once - either immediately if the coelement is available or later when it is instantiated.

`@param selectorOrNode` an snode, tnode, TargetNode or [source/target document selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_object_model/Locating_DOM_elements_using_selectors).

`@param getfunc` an optional function that will be called now or later exactly once with the CoElement of this node supplied.

## Use

The `get` function is used to get the Component (CoElement) so that functions on it can be called. If the Component has been rendered already then it is returned. If not, and a getfunc is supplied, the function is queued for calling when the component is next rendered.

## Examples

### Calling a function 

</co-markdown>
<co-code mode="javascript" class="u-code-10">
// call a function setTitle() on the component co-creature-tbar
this.get('co-creature-tbar',(co)=>{
  co.setTitle('Creatures');
});

</co-code>

<co-nav show-title="false"></co-nav>

<div class="u-page-spacer"></div>
