## `params() : any;` 

Returns the parameter block as set by any parent Component for this component

## Use

`params()` is used to fetch data stored by a parent component for its children. This lets child Components fetch state information explicitly set for them by a parent for an iteration of a child.

This method works even when child Components are [invalidated](@coml-fns/invalidate.html) or are painted after the parent iteration has completed, due to asynchronous execution.

A parent sets parameter information for its childeren during rendering, by passing in the child's tag, iteration number and parameter to the [Render.renderChildren()](@render.html) function.

## Examples

See [Using nested elements](@comp-js/step4.html)
