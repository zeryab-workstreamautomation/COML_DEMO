Tags such as `co-popup` or `for` are components. 

A COML component can be written in Javascript or in COML itself. 

In the `for` example the component is written in Javascript (Or Typescript). Such components provide a lower level of functionality that is easier to code in Javascript.

The `co-popup` component is written in COML. It is a COML Template that just combines ordinary html and other COML components (including other COML Templates) to provide some new functionality.

All COML pages are automatically COML Templates. This means any page can be imported and used as a component inside another page.

By assembling components and templates in this fashion, complex applications can be built in a maintainable and extensible way.

## Importing components

To use a component, use the [import](@coml-fns/import.html) function:

</co-markdown> 

<co-code mode="javascript" class="u-code-small">
   this.import('coml/element/For'); // a component written in Javascript.    
   this.import({name='introduction.html',type='page'},'co-intro'); // a component written in COML (a COML Template). You can use is as <co-intro></co-intro>    
</co-code>

<co-markdown>

## COML Templates

The following is an example of a component template  - The  `popup` template:

</co-markdown> 

<co-code src="element/popup.html" class="u-code-big">
</co-code>

<co-nav show-title="false"></co-nav>
<div class="u-page-spacer"></div>

</body>
