Components can be written in either Javascript (including Typescript which transpiles to Javascript), or in COML itself.

Components written in COML are called `COML Templates`.

A component that manipulates other JS libraries, calls 3rd party service APIs or fetches / sends data to a server is usually written in Javascript. The tutorial to create one [starts here](@comp-js/step1.html).

A component that acts as a container of other component heirarchies is usually written in COML. The tutorial to create a template [starts here](@comp-coml/step1.html).
